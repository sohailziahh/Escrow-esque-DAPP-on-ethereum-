# Escrow-esque-DAPP-on-ethereum-
Built a very simple escrow-esque smart contract using Solidity that allows user to deposit ether into the contract only to be released by a third party to its eventual destination.   Keep in mind, of course, that it's exactly these kind of third parties that the blockchain's going to allow us to circumvent, but I am doing it this way for simplicity.   This could easily be modified to have the funds released based on some kind of off-chain event that won't require any user interaction.  A simple user interface is built that will allow users to send ether from one address to another, check the balance that's being stored, see who the approver is, and finally enable the approver to approve the transaction.
